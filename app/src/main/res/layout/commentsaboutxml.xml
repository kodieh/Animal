    To be perfectly honest, all of the XML is pretty straight forward
    based on what name of the view type it is (ListView, TextView, etc).
    Therefore this comment file serves as a general comment that anything
    in this folder is for layouts and thats exactly what it does. Thank you
    for your time and consideration
